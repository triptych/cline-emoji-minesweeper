# Emoji Minesweeper Clone Implementation Guide

Create a modern, responsive web-based Minesweeper clone using emojis for graphics. The game should feature an engaging UI, score tracking, and save/load functionality.

## Core Requirements

### Game Board

- Create a responsive grid system that adapts to screen size
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for layout
- Support 3 difficulty levels:
  - Beginner: 9x9 grid, 10 mines
  - Intermediate: 16x16 grid, 40 mines
  - Expert: 30x16 grid, 99 mines

### Emoji Graphics

- Covered cell: üü¶
- Revealed cell (empty): ‚¨ú
- Mine: üí£
- Flag: üö©
- Numbers (1-8): Use colored numbers or number emojis
- Explosion (game over): üí•
- Victory: üèÜ

### Game Mechanics

1. Left-click to reveal cells
2. Right-click to place/remove flags
3. First click should never be a mine
4. Show adjacent mine count for revealed cells
5. Implement flood fill for empty cells
6. Game over when mine is clicked
7. Victory when all non-mine cells are revealed

4. Follow object-oriented principles
5. Add comprehensive error handling

## Development Steps

1. Setup project structure
2. Implement basic UI layout
3. Create game board generation
4. Add cell reveal mechanics
5. Implement mine placement
6. Add win/lose conditions
7. Create save/load functionality
8. Add scoring system
9. Implement responsive design
10. Add quality of life features
11. Polish UI and animations
12. Test and debug

## Testing Considerations

1. Test on multiple devices/browsers
2. Verify touch controls
3. Test save/load functionality
4. Validate scoring system
5. Check responsive behavior
6. Verify win/lose conditions
7. Test edge cases

## Performance Optimization

1. Minimize DOM operations
2. Use event delegation
3. Optimize animations
4. Implement efficient flood fill
5. Lazy load non-essential features

## Accessibility

1. Keyboard navigation
2. Screen reader support
3. Sufficient color contrast
